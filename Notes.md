<!-- Notes for current project:

Todo:

Landing page {
  page for signup/login
  boolean to differentiate between the two states

  signup {
    h(3?): Welcome to Taskit
    p: signup to get things done
    form {
      firstname, lastname, email, password (all required)
    }
    p: have a password?
    submit button
  }
  login {
    h(3?): welcome back
    p: lets get to work
    form {
      email, password
    }
    p: dont have an account
    submit button
  }

}

Styling: priority (figure out what you want to do)

Filters (use pipes, either filter or create your own)

Challenge: Pagenation(?) make pages of tasks after so many

Checkmark button: change task to completed(?)

Account info has to come from authentification API (future problem)

Bugs:
